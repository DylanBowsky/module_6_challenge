# Module 6 Visualization  
# Portfolio Analysist 
The goal for this financial notebook is to show the data in the San Francisco housing market. We will be able to analyze the data to show which neighborhoods will generate a healthy profit from rent and price per square foot. We can compare and contrast different sectors of the city with the interactive map we offered in the notebook.

# Technologies Used
We used Jupyter notebook, .env, api's, pandas, hvplot, and mapbox.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation
We will need Pandas, load_dotenv, mapbox api,  and matplotlib, and Path from pathlib. An optional install could be seaborn for heat maps and different variety of graphs.

# Example
We use our api key to access the world map and we select the area we would like to cover in this case San Francisco we gather the data from the key such as neighborhood names, longitude, and latitude then we look prices per square foot in each neighborhood and average rent in the last 7 years. We now have an interactive map with our data ploted in each repective area in the city with data for our investors to easily access with color and size representations.
